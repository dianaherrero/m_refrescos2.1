TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -20.326 ns between utt/uut1/dinero_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and dec/leds_display_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -20.679 ns between utt/uut1/dinero_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and dec/leds_display_reg[5]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
